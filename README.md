# Real Cloud Threat Visualizer

A **real-time cybersecurity monitoring dashboard** that visualizes simulated cloud attack events (brute force, phishing, port scans) across fake endpoints built using **Node.js, Socket.IO, React, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts**.

---

##  Features
- Real-time simulated attack data stream
- WebSocket communication (Socket.IO)
- Interactive live charts and attack logs
- Animated topology map of fake cloud endpoints
- 100% local & cost-free (no AWS/Google credentials)

## Project Concept
```bash
This project simulates cybersecurity telemetry and visualizes it like a real SIEM or cloud threat dashboard.
It’s designed for beginner-to-intermediate cloud & security students to demonstrate understanding of cloud monitoring pipelines and visualization design.
